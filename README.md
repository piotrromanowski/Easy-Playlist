# Easy-Playlist
Chrome extension that will play youtube videos. Alternative to constantly using Spotify.

Idea inspired by https://github.com/feross/YouTube-Instant

I found myself constantly on yinstant whenever I wanted to listen to a sequence of related songs from a youtube query and
thought it would have been cool to use it from a chrome extension for convenience. I also intended to be able to continue playing
the videos with the chrome extension hidden. 


Due to Youtubes TOS I forfeited this project because I didn't want to violate their conditions.
Also I found restrictions with using their api where it does not support authoirzation requests from file systems.
